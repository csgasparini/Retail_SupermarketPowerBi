As the repository with the same name in this GitHub, I made a Power Bi Dashboard with the dataset available on Kaggle from a a supermarket chain that has multiple stores across the United States. 
The dataset contains information aon regional and city-level sales, discount strategies, and profit margins.

The goal of this dashboard was to analyze **regional** and **category-level performance**, focusing on:

- Sales
- Profit
- Average discount  
- Regions  
- Product category insights

- 📁 Dataset: Source: Kaggle / Sample Superstore dataset;

- 🔧 Tools & Technologies: Power Bi Desktop;
